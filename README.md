Overview

This project analyzes sentiment in social media posts (tweets) using machine learning. It classifies text as either Positive or Negative sentiment,
ignoring Neutral classifications for binary analysis.

Key Features

Sentiment Classification: Predicts if a tweet expresses Positive or Negative sentiment

Multiple Models: Includes Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and LSTM neural network implementations

Web Interface: Flask-based web app for interactive sentiment analysis

Data Processing: Text preprocessing with NLTK (stopword removal, stemming)

Random Forest Classifier  
Accuracy: 84.34%

Naive Bayes Classifier  
Accuracy: 83.92%

LSTM Neural Network   
Training Accuracy: 94.07%
